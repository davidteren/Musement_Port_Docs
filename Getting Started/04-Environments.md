PORTA offers a **sandbox** environment at `https://prod.api.tui/tui-musement-porta-site`. This environment exists exclusively for testing your integration with PORTA and is not connected to other Musement systems such as the business platform. The sandbox environment includes additional endpoints for [testing webhook requests][1].

The **production** environment is available at `https://prod.api.tui/tui-musement-porta`.
