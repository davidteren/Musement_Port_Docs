# Intro to PORTA

> ## Excerpt
> Learn how you can access PORTA to manage your experiences on Musement.

Last updated 2 months ago

Welcome to the Musement _supplier_ API documentation!

This documentation is for suppliers who want to manage their experiences in the Musement catalog via their own API integration.

## [][1]Why PORTA?

While Musement's [business platform][2] allows suppliers to curate their portfolio, manually managing availability for multiple experiences can become time-consuming. Suppliers with sufficient "tech know-how" can speed up their workflow by integrating with our supplier API service, **PORTA** (_Perfect Open Road To Activities_).

An integration with PORTA allows suppliers to use their own systems to synchronize dates, prices and bookings with experiences in the Musement catalog. By letting the computers do all the work, you save yourselves time for more human matters (coffee breaks, for example).

## [][3]Registration

Before suppliers can begin using PORTA, they need an account on Musement's [business platform][4]. Registration is free, but you won't be able to create an experience or access PORTA until a member of the _Offer Supply_ team gets in touch to verify your business platform account.

Once your account has been verified, contact your _Offer Supply_ representative for access to PORTA. After contract negotiations, you will receive credentials from our _Integrations_ team to use for the API.

## [][5]Publishing

Experiences created in PORTA are not automatically added to Musement's catalog. A member of the _Content Supplier Connectivity_ team must connect the PORTA experience to an experience in the business platform. The text content and images must pass a preliminary review before the experience can be published to the catalog.

Once an experience is published, bookings will be sent back to the supplier through PORTA via webhook.

Below is a simple diagram to visualize the relationship between a supplier and Musement's catalog via PORTA and the business platform:
